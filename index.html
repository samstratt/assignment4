                <p>The new iMac comes in 7 different colors! At first, I thought the design was ugly, but it has grown on me. My favorite colors are red and orange.</p>

            <h3>1998</h3>

            <p>The iMac G3 was introduced in August 1998 and saved Apple from going bankrupt. The computer revolutionized personal computing and was designed by Jonathan Ives. It came in 5 exciting colors and was the first "i" product from Apple. The "i" stood for internet.</p>

            <h3>2021</h3>

            <p>The 2021 24" iMac was <span>"inspired by the best of apple"</span> and got everyone in their feelings about their childhood dreams of owning a colorful iMac. Outside of the color, not much else is still the same. The screen is better, the chip is better, the storage is better, the mouse is better. (well, maybe not the mouse)</p>
